title: Differential Expression
type: object
description: |-
  Runs differential expression between two sets of cells. The functional behavior of this task shall be as follows:

  (1) The cells in the experiment should be subset by the cell set specified in `basis`. Differential expression should only be run on cell that are in the `basis` cell set.
  (2) Differential expression should be run on two cell sets, as specified in `cellSet` and `compareWith`.
properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: The name of this work -- must be `DifferentialExpression`.
    pattern: DifferentialExpression
  basis:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The cell set for preliminary selection of cells to compare.

      This must be a valid UUID of a cell set as found in DynamoDB. All operations in `DifferentialExpression` will only consider cells that are found in this cell set.

      If not specified, no preliminary selection is done and the entire experiment is used as a basis for computation.
  cellSet:
    type: string
    description: The first cell set differential expression is run on. This must be a valid UUID of a cell set as found in DynamoDB.
  compareWith:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The second cell set to compare against. This may be another cell set UUID, `rest`, or `background`.

      If it is a UUID, the comparison is made between the UUID in `cellSet` and the UUID specified here.

      If it is `rest`, the comparison is made between the UUID in `cellSet` and all remaning cells under the same cell set hierarchy (e.g. scratchpad).

      If it is `background`, the comparison is made between the UUID in `cellSet` and all other cells in the experiment.
  maxNum:
    type: integer
    description: 'The top number of genes to return ordered by the `zScore`. If blank, all genes are returned.'

  - name
